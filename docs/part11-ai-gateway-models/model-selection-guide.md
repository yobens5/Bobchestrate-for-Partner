# Quick AI Gateway and Model Selection Guide

A quick reference for understanding AI Gateway capabilities and choosing models for your watsonx Orchestrate agents.

## AI Gateway Overview

The AI Gateway provides a unified interface to access multiple LLM providers:

```
Your Agents → AI Gateway → External Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
              ↓
         Policies & Governance
```

### Key Benefits

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Unified API** | Single interface for all model providers |
| **Flexibility** | Switch providers without code changes |
| **Governance** | Centralized policies and controls |
| **Monitoring** | Track usage, costs, and performance |
| **Security** | Secure credential management |

## Default Platform Model

| Model | Provider | Speed | Best For |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| **groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b** | Groq / AWS Bedrock | ⚡⚡⚡ | General purpose, tool calling, production use |

**Recommended as the default choice for most use cases.**

## External Model Providers

### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Strengths | Use Cases |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **OpenAI** | Advanced reasoning, broad capabilities | Complex tasks, general purpose |
| **Anthropic** | Long context, analysis, safety | Document analysis, research |
| **Google** | Multimodal, fast inference | Vision tasks, quick responses |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Enterprise features, compliance | Regulated industries, enterprise |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Microsoft integration | Enterprise Microsoft shops |
| **Ollama** | On-premises, privacy | Data-sensitive applications |

### When to Use External Providers

```
Start Here: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b (default)
    |
    ├─ Need specific capabilities not in default?
    │   └─ YES → Consider external provider
    │
    ├─ Have compliance requirements?
    │   └─ YES → AWS Bedrock or Azure
    │
    ├─ Need on-premises deployment?
    │   └─ YES → Ollama
    │
    └─ Default model meets needs?
        └─ YES → Stay with default (recommended)
```

## Model Policies

Model policies allow you to coordinate multiple models for load balancing, fallback, and retry strategies.

### Policy Strategy Types

| Strategy | Purpose | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **loadbalance** | Distributes requests between models based on weight | Balance load across multiple model instances |
| **fallback** | Uses another model if one becomes unavailable | High availability and resilience |
| **single** | Uses one model with retry capability | Simple retry logic for transient errors |

### Load Balancing Policy Example

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model
name: balanced_gpt
description: Load balances between two GPT model instances
display_name: Balanced GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: loadbalance
    on_status_codes: [503, 504]
  retry:
    attempts: 1
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
      weight: 0.75   # 75% of traffic
    - model_name: aws-bedrock/gpt-oss-120b
      weight: 0.25   # 25% of traffic
```

### Fallback Policy Example

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model
name: resilient_gpt
description: Falls back to alternative model on errors
display_name: Resilient GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: fallback
  retry:
    attempts: 1
    on_status_codes: [503, 500]
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
    - model_name: aws-bedrock/gpt-oss-120b
```

### Single Model with Retry Example

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model
name: retry_gpt
description: Single model with retry on transient errors
display_name: Retry GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: single
  retry:
    attempts: 3
    on_status_codes: [503]
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Agent (Default Model)

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: support_agent
description: Standard support agent

instructions: |
  You are a helpful customer support agent.

# Use default platform model
llm: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b

tools:
  - check_order_status
```

### Agent with External Model

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: advanced_agent
description: Agent using external model

instructions: |
  You are an advanced support specialist.

# Use external OpenAI model (requires AI Gateway configuration)
llm: virtual-model/openai/gpt-4-turbo

tools:
  - check_order_status
```

### Agent with Model Policy

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: resilient_agent
description: Agent with fallback model policy

instructions: |
  You are a customer support agent with high availability.

# Use model policy for resilience (policy must be created first)
llm: resilient_gpt

tools:
  - check_order_status
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Default First
- Start with groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b for all agents
- Only add external models when specifically needed
- Monitor usage and costs regularly

### Strategy 2: Tiered Access
- **Standard agents:** Default model (80% of use cases)
- **Advanced agents:** External models (15% of use cases)
- **Specialized agents:** Premium models (5% of use cases)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Default Model for Production

```yaml
# Most production agents should use the default model directly
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: production_agent
description: Standard production agent

instructions: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

llm: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

### Pattern 2: Load Balanced for High Volume

```yaml
# Create policy first, then reference it
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: high_volume_agent
description: Agent with load balanced models

instructions: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

llm: balanced_gpt  # References the load balancing policy
```

### Pattern 3: Fallback for Resilience

```yaml
# Create fallback policy first, then reference it
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: resilient_agent
description: Agent with automatic fallback

instructions: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

llm: resilient_gpt  # References the fallback policy
```

## Decision Checklist

Before choosing a model, ask:

- [ ] Does the default model (groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b) meet my needs?
- [ ] Do I have specific requirements that need an external provider?
- [ ] Have I configured appropriate policies?
- [ ] Am I monitoring costs and usage?
- [ ] Have I tested the model with real scenarios?
- [ ] Is my API key management secure?
- [ ] Have I documented my choice?

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: External model not available
**Check:**
- Available models: `orchestrate models list`
- Connection configuration: `orchestrate connections list`
- Model name spelling

### Issue: High costs
**Solutions:**
- Review usage patterns
- Implement stricter policies
- Use default model where possible

### Issue: Slow responses
**Solutions:**
- Check provider status
- Consider faster models
- Review network connectivity

## Best Practices Summary

### ✅ DO:
- Start with default model (groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
- Implement policies from day one
- Monitor usage and costs regularly
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Test thoroughly before production
- Document model choices

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use external models without clear need
- Skip policy configuration
- Hardcode API keys
- Ignore cost monitoring
- Deploy untested models
- Forget about compliance
- Mix development and production configs
