# Helpful Bob Prompts for watsonx Orchestrate Development

This guide contains useful prompts to help you work with Bob throughout the workshop and beyond.

## Workshop Task Pattern

In the workshop, Bob is expected to do the work with you—not only explain it.
Adapt this compact pattern for each artifact:

```text
Inspect the relevant project files and custom rules. Consult the watsonx
Orchestrate documentation MCP for ADK 2.12.0 syntax. Create or update the
requested artifacts, show me what changed, and validate them. After I review
them, import them into the active draft environment using the existing .venv
and verify they are listed. Suggest a small test set with normal, edge, and
failure cases, then start the appropriate chat or test command.
```

Review generated files and commands before approving them. Never paste API keys
or other secrets into Bob chat; enter them only in dedicated credential prompts.

## Tips for Effective Bob Prompts

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific**: Include relevant code, error messages, or context
- **State your goal**: Explain what you're trying to achieve
- **Provide examples**: Show what you've tried or what you want
- **Ask follow-ups**: Build on Bob's responses with clarifying questions
- **Request explanations**: Ask Bob to explain the reasoning behind suggestions

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Be vague**: "Bob, fix this" without context
- **Skip context**: Not providing relevant code or configuration
- **Expect mind-reading**: Bob needs information about your specific situation
- **Ignore suggestions**: Bob's recommendations are based on best practices
- **Ask multiple unrelated questions**: Focus on one topic at a time

## Example Conversation Flow

Here's an example of an effective conversation with Bob:

```
You: Bob, I need to create a customer support agent that can check order status and process refunds.

Bob: [Provides initial agent structure]

You: Thanks! Can you also add a tool that checks order status? It should take an order ID and return the status, items, and delivery date.

Bob: [Creates order status tool]

You: Great! Now I'm getting an error when I import the tool. Here's the error: [paste error]

Bob: [Analyzes error and provides fix]

You: Perfect! Can you now update the agent YAML to use this tool?

Bob: [Updates agent configuration]

You: Excellent! Can you generate some test cases for this agent?

Bob: [Provides test scenarios]
```

## Quick Reference

### Most Common Prompts

1. **Create**: "Bob, create a [type] that does [function]"
2. **Debug**: "Bob, why is [thing] not working? Here's the [code/error]"
3. **Improve**: "Bob, improve [code/config] by [specific improvement]"
4. **Explain**: "Bob, explain [concept] in the context of [use case]"
5. **Review**: "Bob, review [code/config] for [issues/best practices]"

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** The more context you provide to Bob, the better the responses will be. Include relevant code, error messages, and explain what you're trying to achieve!

**🎯 Remember:** Bob is your AI pair programmer. Use Bob to learn, not just to get answers. Ask Bob to explain the reasoning behind suggestions!
