### Key Capabilities

1. **Provider Abstraction** - Agents don't need to know which provider they're using
2. **Policy Enforcement** - Centralized governance and compliance
3. **Usage Tracking** - Monitor costs and performance across all models
4. **Failover Support** - Automatic fallback to alternative providers
5. **Rate Limiting** - Control usage to manage costs

## Step 2: Configuring External Model Providers

### How to Connect to an External Model

To connect an external model provider to watsonx Orchestrate, you need to follow these key steps:

#### 1. Create a Connection Definition

First, establish a connection to your external provider by configuring the necessary credentials and endpoint information. This typically involves:

- **Provider credentials** - Normally an API key
- **Endpoint configuration** - Base URL and region settings for the provider - needed for custom providers
- **Authentication method** - How the gateway will authenticate with the provider - if something else than API key

> If you want to test this with OpenAI for example, you can get your api key from here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys, you need to login / create your developer account first though. You can see the available OpenAI models here: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/all

##### Option A: Ask Bob first

```
Bob, create a script that adds a new connection definition for importing an OpenAI LLM model with an API key to both draft and live environments. Connection app-id should be "openai". First detect my operating system, then generate a single script for my platform: a .sh file for macOS/Linux or a .ps1 file for Windows PowerShell. Do not require Git Bash or WSL.
```

Check that the connection was created and configured for both environments. If not, use Option B below.

##### Option B: Do it yourself (fallback)

Example API Key connection configuration:
```bash
orchestrate connections add -a openai
orchestrate connections configure -a openai --env draft -k key_value -t team
orchestrate connections set-credentials -a openai --env draft -e "api_key=<your_openai_api_key>"
```
>NOTE: The `--env draft` flag indicates that the configuration is for draft environment. If you want to use it with agents deployed also to production, you need to create the connection with `--env live` as well.

> **Security Note:** Always use environment variables or secure credential management systems for API keys. Never commit credentials to version control.

#### 2. Add the Model Definition

Once the connection is established, you can add specific models using either of two methods:

**Method A: Using a YAML File (Recommended for complex configurations)**

Create a model definition file:
```yaml
# gpt-5.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model
name: openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07
display_name: GPT 5
description: |-
    GPT-5 is our flagship model for coding, reasoning, and agentic tasks across domains. Learn more in our GPT-5 usage guide.
tags:
- openai
- gpt
model_type: chat
```

##### Option A: Ask Bob first

```
Bob, create a script that imports an external model "openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07" from OpenAI using the connection definition "openai" to both draft and live environments. First detect my operating system, then generate a single script for my platform: a .sh file for macOS/Linux or a .ps1 file for Windows PowerShell. Do not require Git Bash or WSL.
```

Check that the model was imported for both environments. If not, use Option B below.

##### Option B: Do it yourself (fallback)

Import the model:
```bash
orchestrate models import -f gpt-5.yaml -a openai
```

**Method B: Using CLI Commands (Quick setup)**

Add a model directly via command line:
```bash
orchestrate models add \
  --name openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07 \
  --description "OpenAI GPT-5 for advanced reasoning" \
  --display-name "GPT 5" \
  --app-id openai \
  --type chat
```

#### 3. Verify the Model

After adding the model, verify it's available:
```bash
# List all available models
orchestrate models list
```

#### 4. Use in Your Agents

Reference the model in your agent configuration:
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: my_agent
description: Agent using external model

llm: virtual-model/openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07   # Reference your external model as it shows when listing models from your orchestrate instance

instructions: |
  Your agent instructions here...
```

## Step 3: Implementing Model Policies

Model policies allow you to coordinate multiple models for load balancing, fallback, and retry strategies.

### Policy Strategy Types

1. **Load Balancing** - Distribute requests across multiple model instances
2. **Fallback** - Automatically switch to backup models on errors
3. **Single with Retry** - Retry failed requests on the same model

### Creating Model Policies

#### Load Balancing Policy

Distributes traffic across multiple models based on weight:

```yaml
# load-balance-policy.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model_policy
name: balanced_gpt
description: Load balances between Groq and AWS Bedrock
display_name: Balanced GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: loadbalance
    on_status_codes: [503, 504]
  retry:
    attempts: 1
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
      weight: 0.75   # 75% of traffic
    - model_name: bedrock/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0
      weight: 0.25   # 25% of traffic
```

#### Fallback Policy

Automatically switches to backup model on errors:

```yaml
# fallback-policy.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model_policy
name: resilient_gpt
description: Falls back to AWS Bedrock if Groq fails
display_name: Resilient GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: fallback
  retry:
    attempts: 1
    on_status_codes: [503, 500]
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
    - model_name: bedrock/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0
```

#### Single Model with Retry

Retries on the same model for transient errors:

```yaml
# retry-policy.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: model_policy
name: retry_gpt
description: Retries up to 3 times on transient errors
display_name: Retry GPT

policy:
  strategy:
    mode: single
  retry:
    attempts: 3
    on_status_codes: [503]
  targets:
    - model_name: groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

### Managing Model Policies

```bash
# Add a policy via CLI
orchestrate models policy add \
  --name resilient_gpt \
  --model groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b \
  --model bedrock/openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0 \
  --strategy fallback \
  --strategy-on-code 503 \
  --retry-attempts 2

# Import from YAML file
orchestrate models policy import --file fallback-policy.yaml

# Export a policy
orchestrate models policy export -n resilient_gpt -o policy.zip

# Remove a policy
orchestrate models policy remove -n resilient_gpt
```

### Applying Policies to Agents

Once created, reference the policy name in your agent's `llm` field:

```yaml
# agent-with-policy.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: resilient_support_agent
description: Support agent with automatic fallback

instructions: |
  You are a customer support agent providing helpful, efficient responses.

# Reference the policy name (not a direct model)
llm: resilient_gpt

tools:
  - check_order_status
  - process_refund
```


## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- **Start with default models** - Use groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b for most use cases
- **Implement policies early** - Set up governance before scaling
- **Monitor usage closely** - Track costs and performance regularly
- **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode API keys
- **Test external models** - Validate behavior before production use
- **Document model choices** - Record why specific models were selected
- **Set up alerts** - Get notified of issues before they become problems
- **Review policies regularly** - Adjust as usage patterns change

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Expose API keys** - Always use secure credential management
- **Skip policy configuration** - Governance is critical for production
- **Ignore cost monitoring** - External models can be expensive
- **Use untested models** - Always validate before production deployment
- **Forget about compliance** - Consider data residency and privacy requirements
- **Overlook rate limits** - Plan for provider limitations
- **Mix environments** - Keep development and production configurations separate

## Key Takeaways
