- Calculate: word count, character count, sentence count, average word length, estimated reading time
- Reading time: assume 200 words per minute

**Ask Bob for help:**
```
Bob, create a text analyzer tool that provides statistics about a piece of text including word count, character count, and reading time
```

**Test text:**
```
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a test sentence."
```

**Expected output:**
- Words: 15
- Characters: 68
- Sentences: 2
- Avg word length: ~4.5
- Reading time: ~5 seconds

**Success criteria:**
- All counts are accurate
- Reading time calculation is reasonable
- Handles empty text
- Handles text with no punctuation

## Exercise 6: Product Search Tool (Advanced)

**Goal:** Create a tool that searches a product catalog

**Task:** Build a tool that searches for products by name, category, or price range.

**Requirements:**
- Function name: `search_products`
- Parameters: `query` (string, optional), `category` (string, optional), `min_price` (float, optional), `max_price` (float, optional)
- Use a mock product database (list of dicts)
- Support partial name matching
- Return sorted results

**Ask Bob for help:**
```
Bob, create a product search tool with a mock database that can search by name, category, and price range
```

**Mock database:**
```python
products = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "category": "Electronics", "price": 999.99},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Mouse", "category": "Electronics", "price": 29.99},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Desk", "category": "Furniture", "price": 299.99},
    {"id": 4, "name": "Chair", "category": "Furniture", "price": 199.99},
]
```

**Test cases:**

Agent: 
1. Uses calculator tool: 85.50 * 0.15 = 12.83
2. Uses formatter tool to create table with original amount, tip, and total
```

**Ask Bob for help:**

## Debugging Exercise

**Goal:** Fix broken tools

**Task:** This tool has several bugs. Find and fix them!

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool
def broken_calculator(num1, num2, operation):
    """Performs calculations"""
    if operation == "add":
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        return num1 / num2
```

**Problems to find:**
1. Missing type hints
2. No input validation
3. Division by zero not handled
4. No return type documentation
5. Vague docstring
6. No error handling
7. Doesn't return structured response

**Ask Bob for help:**
```
Bob, review this calculator tool and identify all the problems: [paste code]
```
